## For Android Integration

### Base URL to Use in Your Android Apps

```java
private static final String BASE_URL = "https://7ef8caf9-d51c-4eeb-8c2a-b180a4f83fc4-00-1vzbsfju3ze94.janeway.replit.dev";
```

Update this URL in these Android files:
- `MainActivity.java`
- `AdMobConfigManager.java`
- `DeviceRegistrationManager.java`
- `PushNotificationManager.java`
- `MyFirebaseMessagingService.java`

### API Endpoints Ready to Use

All endpoints are now live and accessible:

1. **GET** `/api/v1/config/{package_name}` - Get AdMob configuration
2. **POST** `/api/v1/device/register` - Register device with FCM token
3. **GET** `/api/v1/notifications/pending?package_name={package_name}` - Get pending notifications
4. **POST** `/api/v1/notifications/track` - Track notification events
5. **POST** `/api/v1/analytics/admob` - Track AdMob analytics

### Test the Integration

You can test the device registration endpoint right now:

```bash
curl -X POST https://7ef8caf9-d51c-4eeb-8c2a-b180a4f83fc4-00-1vzbsfju3ze94.janeway.replit.dev/api/v1/device/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "package_name": "com.moho.wood",
    "fcm_token": "test_token_123",
    "device_info": {
      "country": "US",
      "app_version": "1.0.0",
      "android_version": "33",
      "manufacturer": "Samsung",
      "model": "Galaxy S23"
    }
  }'
```

## Firebase Push Notifications

### How It Works

Your Laravel backend can now:
1. **Send Push Notifications** to Android devices via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
2. **Track Notification Events** (displayed, clicked, dismissed)
3. **Manage In-App Notifications** that appear when users open the app

### Sending Notifications

The system uses your Firebase credentials to send push notifications to registered devices. You can:

- Send notifications immediately via the dashboard
- Schedule notifications for future delivery
- Target specific apps or devices
- Track delivery and engagement metrics

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Your First App in the Dashboard

1. Access the admin dashboard at: `https://your-repl-url.replit.dev/admin/login`
2. Login with: `admin` / `admin123`
3. Go to **Apps** → **Add New App**
4. Enter your Android app details:
   - Package Name: `com.moho.wood` (or your app's package name)
   - App Name: Your app's display name
   - Platform: Android
   - Status: Active

### 2. Configure AdMob Account

1. Go to **AdMob Accounts** → **Add New**
2. Enter your AdMob ad unit IDs
3. Assign the account to your app

### 3. Test Device Registration

1. Update the BASE_URL in your Android app code
2. Build and run your Android app
3. The app should automatically:
   - Register the device with the backend
   - Fetch AdMob configuration
   - Check for pending notifications

### 4. Send Your First Test Notification

Use the dashboard to create and send a test notification to verify the Firebase integration is working.

## Troubleshooting

### If Push Notifications Don't Work

1. Verify Firebase project ID matches: `server-check-64d4d`
2. Check that FCM tokens are valid and up-to-date
3. Review Laravel logs at `storage/logs/laravel.log`
4. Ensure Android app has Firebase Cloud Messaging enabled

### If Device Registration Fails

1. Verify the app exists in the dashboard with the correct package name
2. Check that the BASE_URL in Android code is correct
3. Ensure FCM token is being sent correctly from Android
4. Check server logs for detailed error messages
